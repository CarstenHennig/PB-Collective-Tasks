## USAGE

Fork this repository and once you are done, create a pull request of your work!

## INSTRUCTIONS

Create a file based on your github username, for example "Req.js". Only edit that file, don't add any other files. Make sure that any code you add is formatted consistently and  very well (indentation levels are logical, for example).

In that file, create 2 student tasks and solutions to each of the following concepts.

    - How if-else statements work
    - How switch statements work
    - How loops work
    - How functions work
    - Solving problems with JavaScript (problems like we have had, such as counting sports scores or censoring words)

For example (loops):

// Task 5. Create a loop that prints out the message "Loopy!" 10 times.
// Solution:
for (let looper = 0; looper <= 10; looper++) { console.log("Loopy!"); }
